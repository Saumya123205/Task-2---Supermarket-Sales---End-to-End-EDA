## 📖 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a supermarket sales dataset to uncover key business insights.  
Using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, the analysis explores sales performance, customer behavior, product line contributions, and branch-level trends.  
The final output is a detailed **EDA report** with visualizations and actionable insights.
